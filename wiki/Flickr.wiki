Please note that they limit the output:

 Geo queries require some sort of limiting agent in order to prevent the database from crying. This is basically like the check against "parameterless searches" for queries without a geo component. 
 A tag, for instance, is considered a limiting agent as are user defined min_date_taken and min_date_upload parameters â€” If no limiting factor is passed we return only photos added in the last 12 hours (though we may extend the limit in the future).
