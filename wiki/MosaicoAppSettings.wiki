= Project Settings =

When we create a new Android Project we must specify certain things before start programming :P so here is one suggestion. We must all agree on one specific set of values.

== Eclipse Project ==
|| *Project Name* || Mosaico ||
|| *Build Target* || Android 2.2 ||
|| *Application Name* || Mosaico ||
|| *Package Name* || `pt.up.fe.android.mosaico` ||
|| *Activity* || <we should choose our activites (screens)> ||
|| *Min SDK Version* || 8 ||
|| *Public App key* || make sure everybody uses the same ||
|| *Google Maps key* || make sure everybody uses the same ||

== Screens & Menus==
*NB!* _for Android every *screen* is an *activity*, every activity is a different *class*! These words will be used as synonyms. _

===Screens===

 # *Main Screen* - The screen with the sliding grid of all photos 
 # *Photo Screen* - The screen where the selected photo will be show 

===Menus===
 # *Main menu* - will appear in the *Main Screen*
  * Options: || Check here! || Favorites || History || Settings ||
   * *Check here!* - Check another gps location (takes you to Google Maps to point at a different location). 
   * *Favorites* - 
   * *History* - 
   * *Settings* - This will be a Preference menu. _see Tutorials_
 # *Photo Menu* -
