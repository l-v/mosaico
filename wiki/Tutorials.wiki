*Tutorials for `Android` beginners like us :P*
 * [http://www.vogella.de/articles/Android/article.html Android Startup] - this tutorial covers the use of *`Android`* with *`Eclipse`*. Totally worth following. It also gives explanations about the basics of an Android App. It is using Gingerbread API but is really basic so it doesn't really matter.

*Tutorial for processing `JSON`*
 * [http://www.vogella.de/articles/AndroidJSON/article.html Processing JSON]

*Tutorial for Location API and Google Maps in Android*
